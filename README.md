# chat_programming_test

Flutter chat sample created in few hours
(i know it's not perfect ;))

## Getting Started

This project is chat programming test.

Flutter Programming Test
Write a small Flutter chat application which satisfies the following minimum requirements:
1) Has an home page where user can see and select 3 conversations
2) Clicking a conversation opens the details page where user can read the related messages
3) User can write a new message, and she will receive an answer (any answer) to it after a short delay, for instance 2s

## Fetch conversations and relative messages from these endpoints:
